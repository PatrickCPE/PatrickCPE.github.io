* Overview
This page contains every useful, cool, funny, wacky, and whatever other adjective you can think of link I can muster.

Listed in no particular order, and hopefully pseudo-organized.

This is how the internet was meant to be used before search engines gave up the motto "Don't be evil" :)
* Hardware
- [[https://wavedrom.com/][Wavedrom]] - The best waveform drawing tool out there
- [[https://verilogguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][FPGA Designs with Verilog]] - A good reference on Verilog and System Verilog synthesizable code
- [[https://www.yosyshq.com/][Yosys HQ]] - The Yosys team develops a ton of great RTL tools (for free!). Yosys for synthesis, SymbiYosys for formal proofs, MCY for formal coverage, CXXRTL which is shaping up to be a Verilator competitor
- [[https://www.fossi-foundation.org/2022/10/19/librecores][FOSSI Foundation]] - The open silicon foundation. They sponsor a bunch of great open source silicon and related tooling
- [[https://opencores.org/][Open Cores]] - A list of open source RTL cores. The site itself is pretty outdated and most folks just mirror to GitHub now. Still there's some great info here
- [[https://chips4makers.io/blog/][Chips4Makers]] - Custom PDK blocks and open source RTL to GDSII flows. At one point he was talking about doing TSMC shuttles for projects and it seemed interesting
- [[https://terostechnology.github.io/terosHDLdoc/index.html][TerosHDL]] - A VSCode extension that gives some nice RTL development features. I hate Microsoft and refuse to use VSCode, but it's a great little package
- [[https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible][Verible]] - An open-source System Verilog parser, linter (format linting only), and formatter
- [[https://github.com/rggen/rggen][RgGen]] - A RTL register generator that will generate RTL, software headers, and documentation for your design written in Ruby
- [[https://www.asic-world.com/code/verilog_tutorial/peter_chambers_10_commandments.pdf][The 10 RTL Commandments]] - 10 Rules to follow to make RTL that works
- [[https://www.asic-world.com/][Asic World]] - A great resource for RTL and RTL verification. Verilog, System Verilog, SystemC, VHDL, and much more
- [[http://www.walkandrollover.com/uml/fpga/][Jim Moran's FPGA Course]] - My professor from Uni's FPGA site. Best professor I've had. His classes got me into semiconductors
- [[https://veripool.org/][Veripool]] - Wilson Snyder runs Veripool. He designed Verilator, Verilog mode for Emacs, and more. You gotta check out his tools
- [[https://www.sunburst-design.com/][Sunburst Designs]] - Cliff Cummings consultancy. One of the best sources out there on digital design and verification. Best white pages ever
- [[https://kevinpt.github.io/symbolator/#installation][Symbolator]] - A great tool to parse your RTL and draw a block diagram. I use this often
- [[https://theamphour.com/][The Amp Hour]] - An electronics podcast hosted by Chris Gammel and Dave Jones. Awesome guests on here and I learn a ton. Great to listen to a bunch of nerds like myself :)
- [[https://www.phils-lab.net/][Phil's Lab]] - Phil has some of the best tutorials on PCB design out there (both paid and free). Also some great guides on signal processing and software
- [[https://nandland.com/][Nandland]] - Russel has one of the best sites out there on Verilog and VHDL for FPGAs. His development board is great too!
- [[https://zipcpu.com/][ZipCPU]] - Dan's site is my go-to source for Verilator and SymbiYosys tutorials. Best guides on formal verification out there. His RTL design tutorials are top notch too
- [[https://voltagedivide.com/][Voltage Divide]] - An interesting page with some FPGA know how
- [[https://fpgadesign.io/][FPGA Design dot IO]] - A nice site with some RTL and FPGA design bits
* Software
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] - The best operating system ever, it only lacks an editor :) Just add Vim mode to it and it becomes the best editor too!
- [[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] - A pre-bundled Emacs configuration that turns it into a modern IDE, and will set up Vim mode for everything. The site was made with this in combination with base Emacs :)
- [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] - The life changing Emacs feature. This website was made in org mode. All my notes are in org mode. I schedule and track all my work and notes in here. Trust me. Check it out
- [[https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/][Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces]] - A free OS textbook hosted online. Fairly comprehensive and a good reference
- [[https://notes.shichao.io/][Shichao's Notes]] - A great reference for Unix info and TCP info
- [[https://www.unixsheikh.com][Unix Sheikh]] - Some more systemd hatred. Some Linux/BSD post, rants, and some good reading
* Security
- [[https://spyware.neocities.org/][Spyware Watchdog]] - A great report on what software is glowing bright as the sun. Also lots of (justified) hatred for cloud flare and the fact it's probably a service for the Glowies and Technocrats
- [[https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20-ender.pdf][Xilinx 7 Series Encryption Crack]] - Because breaking stuff is fun :)
* Math
- [[http://ciphersbyritter.com/][Ciphers By Ritter]] - Awesome resource on encryption, ciphers, and strangely audio amps too
- [[https://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~dwjones/][Douglass Jones]] - A professor from the University of Iowa. Great tutorials on Binary arithmetic (it's complicated when you care about precision & division folks!)
* Blogs
** Hardware
