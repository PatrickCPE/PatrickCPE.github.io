* Overview
ZSH is a nearly POSIX compliant shell, but the ZSH environment for development is very nice. This guide goes over install, and how I set it up, alongside my typical workflow.

I use the Oh-My-ZSH plugin manager to sort out my packages
* ZSH
** Installation
First lets install the ZSH package. This is how I do it on Ubuntu.
#+begin_src shell
sudo apt install zsh
#+end_src
That handles the shell itself. Next up is our plugin manager.

oh-my-zsh reccomends you blindly execute a shell script, which I'm never a fan of. Instead lets download it, check it, then run it.
#+begin_src shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh >> /tmp/install.sh
less /tmp/install.sh
#+end_src
From a read through of the script you can see it downloads a default oh-my-zsh setup, sets ZSH to the default shell, creates your configuration files, and configures any other tidbits.

Let's go ahead and install it
#+begin_src shell
sh /tmp/install.sh
# and lets cleanup
rm /tmp/install.sh
#+end_src
Make sure when installing we say yes to changing our default shell, and I recommend taking the oh-my-zsh template. Your old .zshrc will be backed up.

In addition, if you don't already have fzf (fuzzy-find) installed lets add it as well for an amazing auto-completion tool
#+begin_src shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf
~/.fzf/install
#+end_src
This will give you great command and path auto-completion. Make sure to allow it to update your .zshrc with the appropriate source command

There's one last tool that well be using, and that's zoxide. Again they recommend blindly running shell scripts. Read it first :)
#+begin_src shell
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/main/install.sh >> /tmp/install.sh
#+end_src
You can see it downloads the appropriate binary for your system architecture and distribution, and install it and the appropriate man pages. It also sets up any shell sourcing that is needed
** Configuration
First off, lets set up our theme. I like powerlevel10k, because it's both pretty and I'm a die hard DBZ fan.
#+begin_src shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git "${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k"
#+end_src
this will allow the theme to be loaded by oh-my-zsh, but we'll need to configure it first. First set the them in your .zshrc
#+begin_src shell
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
#+end_src
First thing after setting the them is to install the fonts per these [[https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k?tab=readme-ov-file#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k][instructions]]. I use alacritty, configure it for whatever terminal you use

Then run the following:
#+begin_src shell
p10k configure
#+end_src
select what you like here, and make sure the prompts about fonts show you have all of the fonts installed properly

After that is all set, lets configure some plugins! We'll be using some from the base oh-my-zsh plugins and some custom. lets install the custom ones first
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/MichaelAquilina/zsh-you-should-use.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/you-should-use
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
#+end_src
Now that caps of the custom plugins I install. Lets update our plugins setting in our ~/.zshrc

Here's what I use:
#+begin_src shell
plugins=(git aliases colored-man-pages colorize copyfile cp extract history tmux vi-mode zoxide virtualenv universalarchive rsync ssh
you-should-use zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions)
#+end_src
Discussions on plugins will be below
** Plugins
*** git
Excellent shorthand aliases for git
*** aliases
Show aliases and allow searching for them
#+begin_src 
als <search term>
#+end_src
Syntax above
*** colored-man-pages
Gives you access to colored man pages
*** colorize
Gives you colorized cat via ccat
Lets you copy a whole file to clipboard via copyfile
*** extract
Extract command to auto-extract any archive format
*** history
Some aliases to search through history quicker
*** tmux
Some useful aliases for tmux connections
*** vi-mode
Give vim bindings when editing the shell session
*** zoxide
Initializes zoxide for you and binds it to z
*** virtualenv
Shows details of the currently activated virtual environment
*** universalarchive
Command to store anything into any archive format
*** rsync
Some useful rsync aliases that automatically put sane defaults
*** ssh
allows auto-completion of host via ~/.ssh/config
*** you-should-use
Prompts you of any alias you could of used instead of the long form command
*** zsh-syntax-highlighting
Highlights syntax :)
*** zsh-autosuggestions
Gives gray prompts of potential commands you could be typing akin to what fish does
